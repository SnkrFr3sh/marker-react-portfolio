                    My name is Marc Pacampara, and I am Full Stack Web Developer. Prior to switching into web development, I was a professional dancer and choreographer for 15 years.

                    I felt like it was time for a change. As with age, my joints started to disagree with the rigourous training, yet my mind continued to push for more creativity. After a few years of seaching, I landed on the design and building of websites. I am exctied to see where this new journey takes me professional and how it shapes my creativity and artistry personally.
